Sub Stock_Formating()	'I wanted to have my code calculate last row for me. Unfortunately, this broke my excel when I ran it on the 	test data and shut my excel off multiple times. I tried multiple edits that worked on different excel sheets. 	I am not sure. I ended up assigning a row to end at. This was the code I was going to use. 

	'LastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
	'For i = 2 to LastRow
